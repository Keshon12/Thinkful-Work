Servers/Clients can be compared to a restaurant in terms of the way it operates. Think of the waiter/waitress as the client. They take your order and leave to the kitchen. Think of the kitchen as the server. The waitress goes to the kitchen and requests whatever you ordered. The kitchen then prepares it and sends the waitress to bring it to you. The waitress then brings back exactly what you requested. This relationship is maintained throughout your stay at the restaurant - only ending when you leave. In other words, whatever you request on that website will be pulled from the server at anytime until you leave the website.
